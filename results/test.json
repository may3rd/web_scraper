        "Problem Statement": "Why there is continuous increase of Keq value when product concentration is reduced? With increase in carbon number, Keq. is also increasing, from the stream results it is evident that concentration is decreasing with increase in carbon number:",
        "Solutions": "When comparing equilibrium constants, note that the exponents are different for each reaction.\nThe equation used to calculate Keq in Aspen Plus as follows:\nKeq = product (fugacity_i^nu_i) / reactant (fugacity_i^nu_i)\nwhere fugacity_i = fugacity of component i (in atm)\nnu_i = stoichiometric coefficient of component i\nSo, when you compare reactions such as\n        4)   Temp. approach               4 CO  + 9 H2   -->  C4 + 4 H2O\n        5)  Temp. approach               5 CO  + 11 H2   -->  C5 + 5 H2O\nIn reaction 4), we have fC4 * fH2O^4 / (fCO^4 * fH2^9), while for reaction 5) we have fC5 * fH2O^5 / (fCO^5 * fH2^11)\nThis is the reason you see continuous increase in Keq value.\nDue the change of exponents, it's not correct to simply compare the numerical value of the equilibrium constant / concentration of reactions\nUser can formulate the reactions as successive reactions, so that they have more similar stoichiometries:\n              Temp. approach               CO  + 2 H2  + C3   -->  C4 + H2O\n              Temp. approach               CO  + 2 H2  + C4   -->  C5 + H2O\nIn this case, you'll see the equilibrium constants have now more similar values, but it is still not straightforward to compare.",
